## compilation
  ### allocator
   #### from lib dir
    make dir - create directories
    make/make all - build allocator
    make clean - clean old files
  ### time measuring program
   #### from examples dir
    make dir - create directories
    make/make all - build time measuring program
    make clean - clean old files
    
## run project
 ### allocator
   #### from lib dir
    ./bin/alloc - run allocator
 ### time measuring program
   #### from examples dir
    ./bin/time_measuring - run time measuring program
